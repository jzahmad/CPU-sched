# CPU Scheduling Algorithms Implementation

## Overview
This project implements several CPU scheduling algorithms including First Come First Serve (FCFS), Round Robin (RR), Non-Preemptive Shortest Job First (NSJF), and Preemptive Shortest Job First (PSJF). Each algorithm is implemented in C language and executed to demonstrate their performance.

## Setup and Installation
- Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git.
- Compile the Code: Navigate to the project directory and compile the code using a C compiler. For example, if you're using GCC, run gcc CPUSche.c -o CPUSche.
- Run the Executable: Execute the compiled program. For example, ./CPUSche.

## Features
### FCFS
-Implements the First Come First Serve CPU scheduling algorithm.
-Demonstrates the execution sequence and waiting times for each process.

### RR (Round Robin)
- Implements the Round Robin CPU scheduling algorithm.
- Allows customization of time quantum.
- Displays the execution sequence and waiting times for each process.

### NSJF (Non-Preemptive Shortest Job First)
- Implements the Non-Preemptive Shortest Job First CPU scheduling algorithm.
- Shows the execution sequence and waiting times for each process.

### PSJF (Preemptive Shortest Job First)
- Implements the Preemptive Shortest Job First CPU scheduling algorithm.
- Provides visualization of the execution sequence and waiting times for each process.

## Usage
- Upon running the program, it reads task specifications from TaskSpec.txt.
- It generates an Output.txt file containing the execution details and waiting times for each algorithm.

## Dependencies
This project relies on standard C libraries and does not require any external dependencies.

## Known Issues
None reported at the moment.

## Future Development Plans
- Implement additional CPU scheduling algorithms.
- Improve efficiency and readability of the code.
